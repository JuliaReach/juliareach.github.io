Abstract: Efficiently handling time-triggered and possibly
nondeterministic switches for hybrid systems reachability is a
challenging task. In this paper we focus on periodically controlled
systems with fast-switching controller dynamics, which often
require simulation time scales of the order of nanoseconds.
Accurate set-based computations for such systems with relatively
large time horizons are expensive due to the accumulation
of errors in the discrete transitions. We present an approach
based on conservative set-based enclosure of the dynamics that
can handle systems with uncertain parameters and inputs. We
demonstrate our algorithm on the plant model of an experimental
electro-mechanical braking system with periodic controller.
