&lt;p&gt;Reachability analysis aims at identifying states reachable by a system within a given time horizon. This task is known to be computationally expensive for linear hybrid systems. Reachability analysis works by iteratively applying continuous and discrete post operators to compute states reachable according to continuous and discrete dynamics, respectively. In this article, we enhance both of these operators and make sure that most of the involved computations are performed in low-dimensional state space. In particular, we improve the continuous-post operator by performing computations in high-dimensional state space only for time intervals relevant for the subsequent application of the discrete-post operator. Furthermore, the new discrete-post operator performs low-dimensional computations by leveraging the structure of the guard and assignment of a considered transition. We illustrate the potential of our approach on a number of challenging benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reachability analysis computes an envelope encompassing the reachable states of a
hybrid automaton within a given time horizon. It is known to be a computationally
intensive task. In this case study paper, we consider the application of reachability
analysis on a mathematical model unifying two key warfighting functions: Combat,
and Commandand-Control (C2). Reachability here has a meaning of whether, given a
range of initial combat forces and a C2 network and various uncertainties,
one side can survive combat with intact forces while the adversary
is diminished to zero. These are questions which arise in military Operations
Research (OR). This paper is the first to utilize the notions of a
hybrid automaton and reachability analysis in the area of OR. We explore the
applicability and scalability of Taylor-model based reachability techniques in this domain.
Our experiments demonstrate the potential of reachability analysis in the context of OR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explored the feasibility of applying some state-of-the-art reachability tools on
a mathematical model unifying the dynamics of combat and C2.
Operations Research is a domain where the advantages of using reachability analysis
are yet to be discovered, and our contribution is a first step towards that direction.
The unified combat model considered appears to be a challenging case
study model, and although current verification techniques demonstrate capabilities to verify the systems up to the necessary time horizon of the model, there are still relevant configurations where reachability tools fail to verify the system.
In particular, we investigated the method based on Taylor models in Flow*
and JuliaReach for cases where the C2 takes place on networks of size N = 3, 5
and 10. Given a certain uncertainty on initial conditions for Blue and Red combat forces we were able to derive reach-tubes for the subsequent time-evolution, bounding the behaviours of both forces and determining whether one side or
the other is guaranteed success in the combat outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the approach with adaptive time step (JuliaReach) has shown the best scalability. We
emphasise that here we examined reachability within the constraint that the
reach-tubes should cover all possible behaviors of the system’s evolution. However, we anticipate that significant scaling benefits may be achieved by relaxing this condition, thus testing that certain states may be reached while allowing for
a degree of approximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the results of the ARCH 2020
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Workshop on Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems&lt;/a&gt; friendly
competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics.
In its fourth edition, eight tools have been applied to solve eight different benchmark problems in the
category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): CORA, C2E2, HyDRA, Hylaa, Hylaa-Continuous,
JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed. This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of
benchmarks they are particularly suited for. Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools,
yet the presented results provide one of the most complete assessments of tools for the safety verification
of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider the verification of hybrid systems (i.e., mixed discrete/continuous systems) with linear continuous dynamics
$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
$$
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$. For all results reported by each participant, we have run an independent repeatability evaluation. To establish further trustworthiness of the results, the code with which the results have been obtained is publicly available &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/goranf/ARCH-COMP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The selection of the benchmarks has been conducted within the forum of the ARCH website
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which is visible for registered users and
registration is open to anybody. All tools presented in this report use some form of
reachability analysis. This, however, is not a constraint set by the organizers of the friendly competition. We hope to encourage further tool developers to showcase their results in future editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid
systems with nonlinear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part of the
workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2020. This year, 6 tools
Ariadne, CORA, DynIbex, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL, and JuliaReach (in alphabetic order) participated.
These tools are applied to solve reachability analysis problems on six benchmark problems, two of them
featuring hybrid dynamics. We do not rank the tools based on the results, but show the current status
and discover the potential advantages of different tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this report, we summarize the results of the fourth ARCH friendly competition on the
reachability analysis of continuous and hybrid systems with nonlinear dynamics. Given a system
defined by a nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) $\dot{x} = f(x, t)$ along with an initial
condition $x \in X_0$, we apply the participating tools to prove properties of the state reachable set
in a bounded time horizon. The techniques for solving such a problem are usually very sensitive
to not only the nonlinearity of the dynamics but also the size of the initial set. This is also one
of the main reasons why most of the tools require quite a lot of computational parameters.
In this report, 6 tools Ariadne, CORA, DynIbex, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL, and JuliaReach
participated in solving problems defined on four continuous and two hybrid benchmarks. The
continuous benchmarks are the Production-Destruction system, the Coupled Van der Pol os-
cillator, the Laub-Loomis model, and a controlled Quadrotor model. The hybrid benchmarks
model a Lotka-Volterra system with a Tangential Crossing, and a Space Rendezvous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2020 edition of the competition we introduced two new benchmarks: the Production-
Destruction system and the Lotka-Volterra system with tangential crossing. The former is a
continuous system aimed at identifying the stability of integration schemes. The latter intro-
duces nonlinear guards and in particular tangential crossings. In addition, we extended the van
der Pol oscillator to two coupled oscillators, introduced nondeterministic crossing in the Space
Rendezvous system and performed some input sensitivity analysis for the Quadrotor system.
The Laub-Loomis benchmark was not modified, in order to perform a direct comparison with
results from the previous year (since the participants are the same).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiently handling time-triggered and possibly nondeterministic switches for hybrid systems
reachability is a challenging task. In this paper we focus on periodically controlled systems
with fast-switching controller dynamics, which often require simulation time scales of the order
of nanoseconds. Accurate set-based computations for such systems with relatively large time
horizons are expensive due to the accumulation of errors in the discrete transitions.
We present an approach based on conservative set-based enclosure of the dynamics that can handle systems
with uncertain parameters and inputs. We demonstrate our algorithm on the plant model of an
experimental electro-mechanical braking system with periodic controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timed systems play an important role in modeling and analyzing cyber-physical systems.
In this work we consider a class of hybrid-automaton models with continuous dynamics and time-triggered discrete events following a periodic clock.
We propose a reachability framework to compute an overapproximation of the states reachable by such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional techniques tightly integrate the computation of the continuous behavior and the discrete events.
Our approach allows to separate these concerns for the model class considered here, which simplifies
the analysis drastically in practice and allows us to plug in any reachability algorithm from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a case study, we consider a parametric model of a cyber-physical system consisting of an experimental
electro-mechanical brake and a software-implemented periodic controller.
The model was originally described in earlier work by Strathmann and Oehlerking where the
authors developed a simplified version of a nonlinear system.
The model is representative of real challenges in the automotive industry and allows the application of formal methods during development.
Computing the reachable states for this simplified model takes twelve hours using the previous
approach, and less than a minute with our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper makes the following original contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an efficient algorithm for deterministic periodic time-triggered hybrid systems with &lt;strong&gt;uncertain parameters&lt;/strong&gt; of the system dynamics or the initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We extend the algorithm to the more difficult and new scenario of &lt;strong&gt;nondeterministic periodic&lt;/strong&gt; discrete switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the &lt;strong&gt;efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; of our algorithm on a model of an electro-mechanical brake system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present JuliaReach, a toolbox for set-based
reachability analysis of dynamical systems.
JuliaReach consists of two main packages: Reachability, containing implementations
of reachability algorithms for continuous
and hybrid systems, and LazySets, a
standalone library that implements
state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus
with convex sets. The library offers both
concrete and lazy set representations, where
the latter stands for the ability to delay
set computations until they are needed. The
choice of the programming language Julia and
the accompanying documentation of our
toolbox allow researchers to easily translate
set-based algorithms from mathematics to
software in a platform-independent way,
while achieving runtime performance that
is comparable to statically compiled languages.
Combining lazy operations in high dimensions
and explicit computations in low dimensions,
JuliaReach can be applied to solve complex,
large-scale problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report presents the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous
and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part
of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2018.
In its second edition, 9 tools have been applied to solve six different benchmark problems
in the category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): CORA, CORA/SX, C2E2,
Flow*, HyDRA, Hylaa, Hylaa-Continuous, JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed.
This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks
they are particularly suited for. Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools,
yet the presented results probably provide the most complete assessment of tools for
the safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes results obtained in the 2018 friendly competition of the ARCH
workshop for verifying hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics
$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
$$
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
Participating tools are summarized in
Sec. 2. The results of our selected benchmark problems are shown in Sec. 3 and are obtained
on the tool developers’ own machines. Thus, one has to factor in the computational power of
the processors used, summarized in Appendix A, as well as the efficiency of the programming
language of the tools.
The goal of the friendly competition is not to rank the results, but rather to present the
landscape of existing solutions in a breadth that is not possible with scientific publications in
classical venues. Such publications would typically require the presentation of novel techniques,
while this report showcases the current state-of-the-art tools. For all results reported by each
participant, we have run an independent repeatability evaluation.
The selection of the benchmarks has been conducted within the forum of the ARCH website
(&lt;a href=&#34;cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34;&gt;cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&lt;/a&gt;), which is visible for registered users
and registration is open for anybody. All tools presented in this report use some form
of reachability analysis. This, however, is not a constraint set by the organizers of
the friendly competition. We hope to encourage further tool developers to showcase
their results in future editions.&lt;/p&gt;

See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3178126.3178128&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ACM Digital Library link&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09526&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv: 1801.09526&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximating the set of reachable states of a dynamical system is an
algorithmic yet mathematically rigorous way to reason about its safety.
Although progress has been made in the development of efficient algorithms
for affine dynamical systems, available algorithms still lack scalability
to ensure their wide adoption in the industrial setting. While modern
linear algebra packages are efficient for matrices with tens of thousands
of dimensions, set-based image computations are limited to a few hundred.
We propose to decompose reach set computations such that set operations
are performed in low dimensions, while matrix operations like exponentiation
are carried out in the full dimension. Our method is applicable both in dense
and discrete-time settings. For a set of standard benchmarks, it shows a
speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the respective
state-of-the-art tools, with only modest losses in accuracy.
For the dense-time case, we show an experiment with more than 10,000
variables, roughly two orders of magnitude higher than possible with previous
approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a new method to solve the reachability
problem for affine dynamical systems with nondeterministic inputs
and experimentally show that it is highly scalable under modest
loss of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We provide a new decomposition approach to solve the set-based recurrence:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathcal{X}(k+1) = \Phi \mathcal{X}(k) \oplus \mathcal{V}(k),\qquad k = 0, 1,\ldots, N
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyze the approximation error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We address both the dense time and the discrete time reach-
ability problem for general linear time-invariant systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implement our approach efficiently and demonstrate its
scalability on real engineering benchmarks. The tool, source
code, and benchmark scripts are publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
