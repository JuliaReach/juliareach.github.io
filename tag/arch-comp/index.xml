Wetzlinger (2020) ARCH20. 7th International Workshop on Applied Verification of Continuous and

(ARCH20), vol 74, pages 16&amp;ndash;48. &lt;a href=&#34;https://easychair.org/publications/paper/DRpS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;10.29007/7dt2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the results of the ARCH 2020
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Workshop on Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems&lt;/a&gt; friendly
competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics.
In its fourth edition, eight tools have been applied to solve eight different benchmark problems in the
category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): CORA, C2E2, HyDRA, Hylaa, Hylaa-Continuous,
JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed. This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of
benchmarks they are particularly suited for. Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools,
yet the presented results provide one of the most complete assessments of tools for the safety verification
of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider the verification of hybrid systems (i.e., mixed discrete/continuous systems) with linear continuous dynamics
$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
$$
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$. For all results reported by each participant, we have run an independent repeatability evaluation. To establish further trustworthiness of the results, the code with which the results have been obtained is publicly available &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/goranf/ARCH-COMP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The selection of the benchmarks has been conducted within the forum of the ARCH website
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which is visible for registered users and
registration is open to anybody. All tools presented in this report use some form of
reachability analysis. This, however, is not a constraint set by the organizers of the friendly competition. We hope to encourage further tool developers to showcase their results in future editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid
systems with nonlinear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part of the
workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2020. This year, 6 tools
Ariadne, CORA, DynIbex, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL, and JuliaReach (in alphabetic order) participated.
These tools are applied to solve reachability analysis problems on six benchmark problems, two of them
featuring hybrid dynamics. We do not rank the tools based on the results, but show the current status
and discover the potential advantages of different tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this report, we summarize the results of the fourth ARCH friendly competition on the
reachability analysis of continuous and hybrid systems with nonlinear dynamics. Given a system
defined by a nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) $\dot{x} = f(x, t)$ along with an initial
condition $x \in X_0$, we apply the participating tools to prove properties of the state reachable set
in a bounded time horizon. The techniques for solving such a problem are usually very sensitive
to not only the nonlinearity of the dynamics but also the size of the initial set. This is also one
of the main reasons why most of the tools require quite a lot of computational parameters.
In this report, 6 tools Ariadne, CORA, DynIbex, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL, and JuliaReach
participated in solving problems defined on four continuous and two hybrid benchmarks. The
continuous benchmarks are the Production-Destruction system, the Coupled Van der Pol os-
cillator, the Laub-Loomis model, and a controlled Quadrotor model. The hybrid benchmarks
model a Lotka-Volterra system with a Tangential Crossing, and a Space Rendezvous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2020 edition of the competition we introduced two new benchmarks: the Production-
Destruction system and the Lotka-Volterra system with tangential crossing. The former is a
continuous system aimed at identifying the stability of integration schemes. The latter intro-
duces nonlinear guards and in particular tangential crossings. In addition, we extended the van
der Pol oscillator to two coupled oscillators, introduced nondeterministic crossing in the Space
Rendezvous system and performed some input sensitivity analysis for the Quadrotor system.
The Laub-Loomis benchmark was not modified, in order to perform a direct comparison with
results from the previous year (since the participants are the same).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report presents the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous
and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part
of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2018.
In its second edition, 9 tools have been applied to solve six different benchmark problems
in the category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): CORA, CORA/SX, C2E2,
Flow*, HyDRA, Hylaa, Hylaa-Continuous, JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed.
This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks
they are particularly suited for. Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools,
yet the presented results probably provide the most complete assessment of tools for
the safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributions&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes results obtained in the 2018 friendly competition of the ARCH
workshop for verifying hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics
$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
$$
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
Participating tools are summarized in
Sec. 2. The results of our selected benchmark problems are shown in Sec. 3 and are obtained
on the tool developersâ own machines. Thus, one has to factor in the computational power of
the processors used, summarized in Appendix A, as well as the efficiency of the programming
language of the tools.
The goal of the friendly competition is not to rank the results, but rather to present the
landscape of existing solutions in a breadth that is not possible with scientific publications in
classical venues. Such publications would typically require the presentation of novel techniques,
while this report showcases the current state-of-the-art tools. For all results reported by each
participant, we have run an independent repeatability evaluation.
The selection of the benchmarks has been conducted within the forum of the ARCH website
(&lt;a href=&#34;cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&#34;&gt;cps-vo.org/group/ARCH&lt;/a&gt;), which is visible for registered users
and registration is open for anybody. All tools presented in this report use some form
of reachability analysis. This, however, is not a constraint set by the organizers of
the friendly competition. We hope to encourage further tool developers to showcase
their results in future editions.&lt;/p&gt;
